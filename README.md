# Brainfuck-Interpreter-in-C

This program can interpreters brainfuck language instructions from the text file. How many instructions you can write? As many as you want! My interpreter is based on the linked list for the brainfuck symbols - that's why you it can read a lot of instructions. Additionally, there is a stack implementation in this interpreter for the nested loops!

## Usage

./brainfuck_interpreter <filename.bf>
